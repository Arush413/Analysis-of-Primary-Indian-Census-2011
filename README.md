In this project I did a study on the Indian Primary Census Abstract for the year 2011.<br>
For the concerned project, I had to give 3 reviews.<br>
First one being the data abstraction of the chosen dataset and also plotting and answering some questions related to the same. I mainly used ggplot2 library for these non-interactive plots.<br>
For the second review, I used ggplot2 as well as plotly library for making interative plots in R.<br>
Lastly, in the third review I made a dashboard containing all of these plots using shiny and shinydashboard libraries.<br>
All this information is included in the "Project Description" file. The dataset can be found in the .csv file included in this repository. I have also included the "dashboard" file which contains the dashboard.
